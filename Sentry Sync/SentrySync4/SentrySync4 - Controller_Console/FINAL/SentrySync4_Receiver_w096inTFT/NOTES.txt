To flash ESP32-C3, you must install esp boards file version 2.0.14 then revert back to esp boards file version 3.2.0 when flashing ESP32 Dev board.
Copy the "libraries" folder into where your arduino libraries are installed. TFT_eSPI library must be installed FIRST, then overwrite with my files.
Don't forget to edit the User_Setup.h to fit your screen/ESP setup.
